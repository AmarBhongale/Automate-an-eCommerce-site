# Automate-an-eCommerce-site


Description -         In these selenium project I develop page object model framework and 
                     use it for search, select and add the product to cart on amazon. I test 
                     the site for a search query like iphone with the specific phone memory 
                     size requirement and then the product will be added to the 
                     Cart.
